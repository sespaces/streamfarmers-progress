   *not* an easy task; more difficult if you are newish to world of nodejs
   
   many errors and failed attempts using ubuntu 18.04...; will try again after [cross fingers here]  success with :
    
   ubuntu 16.04 server + lightdm , nodej10.6/npm6.13, 
    
   git clone remix-ide

    best result thus far is to serve index.html that fails to load "./build/app.js"
    
    the file is there and permissioned correctly but fetch attempt yields 404 error
