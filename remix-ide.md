## Remix-IDE

### Installation
    
   *not* an easy task; more difficult if you are newish to world of nodejs
   
   many errors and failed attempts using ubuntu 18.04...; will try again after [cross fingers here]  success with :
    
   ubuntu 16.04 server + lightdm , nodej10.6/npm6.13, 
    
   git clone remix-ide 
   
   curl localhost:8080

- 7:30am (status)

    best result thus far is to serve index.html that fails to load "./build/app.js"
    
    the file is there and permissioned correctly but fetch attempt yields 404 error
  
  
- 8:30am (implement X11 forwarding)

    working on this issue brings up another issue for me: how to remotely use a web-browser to view "localhost" content from the server

    X11 Forwarding is the answer

    I haven't used it before, and it took a little delving, but I now have it working

    requires two steps, one each for server and client

    on server: in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, set "X11Forwarding yes" and reload sshd

    on client: in ~/.ssh/config (create if necessary), add "ForwardX11 yes"

  9:15am (x11forwarding chromium-browser installations mismatched)

    so X11Forwarding is partially successful; SublimeText works, but Chromium Browser not so much; seems client and server are running different versions....

    installed firefox and it works

    server's localhost comes up, but not the 8080...

  10:40am (getting to know npm)

    looking at log files from failing remix-ide service; have tried several methods from several angles each; time to understand the node-js package management system

    its power and simplicity are very impressive; very tight; reading the help files makes me feel like I am getting smarter just by seeing their form

    I think I have now just uninstalled everything remix-ide related
    $ sudo nmp uninstall -g -S -D remix*


    had earlier apt installed git-all

    thanks to some documentation along the way, I am checking travis-cl to learn which versions of things remix passed on

    https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/remix-ide

    which leads to same for remix-live which says that: NOT PASSING! fuck; oh, wait, it is not configured for testing directly; the passing example in the main remix-ide includes remix-live along with it and it passes...

    I see in the configuration file for the build tester that they are using node version 9.11.2 and not the latest nor 10.2 as someone else suggested.....

    $ sudo n 9.11.2
    ...: installed : v9.11.2 (with npm 5.6.0)

and the frustration continues; yes I know a little more than I did before, but fuck

- 8:10am (regroup and refresh)

  now I know a bunch more, having spent a good part of yesterday and the early part of this morning working on the issue and on regrouping in preparation for another attack upon it (sounds too vicious; what an ugly descriptor -- stop; breathe.)

  part of regrouping has been to tidy up my workspace a bit; here is something I like to add to the end of my .bashrc; the "ec" alias is for "edit [bash]configuration" and just makes it easier to tweak the settings
    ...
    alias ec='nano ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc'
    export PS1="\n\n\l:\!   \h:\u    \w     \@ \n\$ "
    ...

  which produces a prompt and output like this:

    0:2006   dhm-laptop:dhm    ~/current/progress     08:49 AM 
    $ subl remix-ide.md


    0:2008   dhm-laptop:dhm    ~/current/progress     08:59 AM 
    $

  two blank lines precede each new prompt, giving separation from prior output; the session number (\l) is 0, meaning this first tty connection; the line number in bash history (\!) is 2008, which is helpful when repeating commands; host (\h) and user (\u) names I usually leave out but currently I am switching between machines and working as root too often to keep track; current working directory (\w) and time (\@) are helpful; 

  what was command 2007 ?
    $ !2007
      tail -4 ~/.bashrc
      alias ec='nano ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc'
      export PS1="\n\n\l:\!   \h:\u    \w     \@ \n\$ "


  stop typing (and so often incorrectly) the ip's of the machines and servers on the network by giving them names

    $ sudo nano /etc/hosts
      ...
      127.0.1.1 solidity solidity.fvill.com remix.fvill.com 
      10.10.100.8 ethel
      10.10.100.3 dhm-laptop lap
      10.10.100.2 dhm
      ...

    now this works:

      $ ssh lap



  make server console displays readable; default size is 8x12 which is too small on screens with decent resolutions

    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

- 10:10am (back to

having multiple areas of ignorance makes it difficult to troubleshoot




- 1:00pm

I have made a new installation of ubuntu 18.10 server with no pre-selected packages; I've run 'apt update' and 'apt upgrade'; sshd is currently allowing me in with password but will accept public key; .bashrc has minor changes as above; also /etc/hosts

I was seemingly having good luck following the installation layout for the Remix-IDE docker file. Until I ran out of disk space. I think that is fixed now.

The original docker file is at:

    $ git clone https://www.github.com/4c0n/remix-ide-docker

I went through the steps, altering for executing on system through shell.

[Installing Remix-IDE](./remix-ide-bash-installation)

This time I made it all the through; and gosh I feel like a big boy.
