Good morning!

I'm still feeling good about finishing the process of JupyterHub deployment. I'm still writing it up.


##### who do sudo? you do sudo 

I've typed "sudo" a million times but never intentionally used the "-E" option! And rarely have I used "-H".

Working through these server setups using various usernames and with various environments. I finally learned to use them (outside of Python wheel-related installs.

`-E` preserves your environment variables that you might need for executing the command

`-H` preserves only the $HOME variable, preventing installation of configuration and cached files, and the like, from being installed in root's home directory.

Today I hope to finish writing up the JupyterHub installation how-to.

I'd like also to install the Julia kernel for JupyterHub and to document that process.
