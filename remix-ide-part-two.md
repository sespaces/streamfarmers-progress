# Remix-IDE Installation -- Ubuntu 18.04 Server and Apache2


## Pre-Installation

- 9:10am (Resizing an LVM)

I've got an ISO for Ubuntu 18.04 Server and 40GB of free disk space.

Or do I have any disk space? Ubuntu's installer wants only to kill whatever is on my disk, as it isn't grokking the LVM already present there. 

I definitely have more to learn about LVM because my ignorance and LVM's attributes have led to frustration and loss. The last time I retried resizing an LVM I destroyed (some useless) partitions.

Not much on this disk needs preserving, but I really hate not knowing how to not waste what has already been done. I will back some directories up then see if I can resize things properly.
