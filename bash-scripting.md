The last time I wrote a shell script was probably a screen menu ".bat" file in the pre-Windows era. Probably MS-DOS 2.x (possibly, but not likely could have even been DR-DOS). How sweet it was to start one of my 5 installed programs with just a press of a number key(!).

But now it's Bash. I need to start a program as a particular user with particular environment settings. There does not seem to be a one-liner that works so let's see what happens
