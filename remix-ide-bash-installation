# These are steps for installing Remix-IDE on a fresh Ubuntu-18.10 installation.

# Based on:
# https://www.github.com/4c0n/remix-ide-docker


# commands will be run either by "root" or "remix"
sudo su

# already have curl git and wget
apt install -y python build-essential

# add the "remix" user, with a password
adduser remix 

# create preferred shared-folder location, instead of "/app"
mkdir /srv/remix
# remix has to have right to write to shared folder; just as soon do:
chown remix:remix /srv/remix

# switch from "root" to "remix" via myself
exit
# after login, working directory is /home/remix
sudo login remix

# for re-use, I added these to /home/remix/.bashrc;
