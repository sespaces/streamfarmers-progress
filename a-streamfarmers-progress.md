### 2020

#### January

##### Week 5

[Remix-IDE](https://github.com/sespaces/remix-ide-server-hosting/blob/master/README.md)

	I had thought setting up my own Remix-IDE would be easier. I was mistaken about how much I didn't know about NodeJS. I learned a few things and got it working nicely, however.

#### February

##### Week 1

[Gitlab Server Setup](./gitlab-installation-ubuntu-18-04.md)

	This was as easy as I imagined. But almost not so. For a while I thought I would have to go throught the long and uncertain process of building it from source. (It has a *lot* of dependencies.)

	Essentially, just use the installer instructions for your system (even if it's a raspberry-pi) from Gitlab's [Install](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) page.

	It even takes care of getting Let's Encrypt certificates.
