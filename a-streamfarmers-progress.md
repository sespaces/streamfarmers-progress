# A Streamfarmer's Progress 

## January
### Week 5
[Remix-IDE](https://github.com/sespaces/remix-ide-server-hosting/blob/master/README.md)
I had thought setting up my own Remix-IDE would be easier. I was mistaken about how much I didn't know about NodeJS. I learned a few things and got it working nicely, however.

## [February](./sp-feb.md)

### Week 1
####[Gitlab Server Setup](./gitlab-installation-ubuntu-18-04.md)
- This was as easy as I imagined. But almost not so. For a while I thought I would have to go throught the long and uncertain process of building it from source. (It has a *lot* of dependencies.)
- Essentially, just use the installer instructions for your system (even if it's a raspberry-pi) from Gitlab's [Install](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) page.
- It even takes care of getting Let's Encrypt certificates.

####[Installing JupyterHub](jupyterhub-server-installation.md)
- This is *definitely* not something that you can just follow their instructions on. The installation documentation is too incomplete and too spread-out. There are many opportunities to err here.
- I didn't know enough about systemd, proxies, and networking ahead of this. 
- I thought I could do this in one day; it took four.
